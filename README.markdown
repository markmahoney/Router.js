Router.js
=========

Router.js is a basic system for managing page loading and transitioning on a route by route basis, 
primarily for sites that don't reload when viewed on JavaScript-enabled user agents. It attempts to 
fix common issues often found in more basic solutions, such as allowing users to hammer repeatedly 
on forward/back buttons, and attempts to provide fine-grained control over how each route is loaded, 
displayed, and unloaded.

It requires a recent copy of jQuery and History.js 1.7 (included in the vendors directory).

Documentation forthcoming. See the demo directory for an example of how it works (needs Flask 
to run: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/).
